Welcome to My Calculator!

This project aims to create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Link to live project: https://rjqocampo.github.io/calculator/ :point_left:

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging
  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and solidify my Javascript and CSS fundamentals

### My Learnings
* Value of conditional statements
* Value of built-in Javascript methods
* Value of Chrome DevTools, specifically the Breakpoints and Watch feature
* Importance of functions, event listeners and DOM manipulation
* Importance of a CSS reset
* Importance of data types. Encountered bugs due to incorrectly interchanging strings and numbers
* Importance of naming variables more clearly to avoid confusion

### Known Issues
* Display is limited to only two decimals to avoid display overflow, so results may produce rounding errors 
* Outputs NaN if display will overflow

### Prospective Updates
* More calculator functions
* Keyboard Support
